> [!DEFINE] Hacker
> A common term used to describe a threat actor and has a variety of meanings:
> - A programmer that can develop programs and edit code
> - A network professional that uses programming skills to secure networks
> - Runs programs to prevent or corrupt data on servers

Types of hackers:
- White hat hacker --> Ethical hacker
- Gray hat hacker --> Commits crimes and unethical things but not for personal gain or to cause damage
- Black hat hacker --> Unethical criminals for personal gain

# Threat Actors
Types of threat actors:
- Script Kiddies --> Teenagers or inexperienced threat actors running existing tools to cause harm but typically not for profit
- Vulnerability Brokers --> Gray hat hackers who attempt to discover exploits and report them to vendors
- Hacktivits --> Gray hat hackers who rally and protest against different political or social ideas
- State-sponsored --> Steal government secrets, gather intelligence and sabotage networks of foreign governments, terrorists... etc
- Cybercriminals --> Black hat hackers who are self-employed or work for large cybercrime organizations

## Cybercriminals
Threat actors who are motivated to make money by any means

Steal billions of dollars from consumers and businesses each year

Operate in underground economy and buy and sell personal information and intellectual property

# Cybersecurity Terminologies

> [!DEFINE]
> Assets: Anything of value for an organization
> Vulnerability: Weakness in a system or its design
> Threat: Potential danger to an asset, data or  network function
> Exploit: Mechanism that take advantage of a vulnerability
> Mitigation: Counter-measure to a threat or attack

# Risks

> [!DEFINE] Risk
> Likelihood a threat can exploit the vulnerability of an asset

Risk matrix consider probability, likelihood and consequence/impact of the risk

## Risk Management

> [!DEFINE]
> Risk acceptance: When the cost of risk management outweighs the cost of risk, the risk is accepted
> Risk avoidance: Avoiding any exposure to risk by eliminating the activity
> Risk Reduction: Reduces the exposure to risk, it is the most commonly used risk mitigation strategy
> Risk transfer: Risk is transferred to third party

# Three Dimensions of Cybersecurity (CIA)
Three dimension:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

## Confidentiality

> [!DEFINE] Confidentiality
> Prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized parties, also known as privacy

- Data encryption
- Authentication
- Access Control

## Integrity

> [!DEFINE] Integrity
> Accuracy, consistency and trustworthiness of data during its entire life cycle, also known as quality

- Hashing
- Data validation checks
- Data consistency checks
- Access Controls

Integrity checks are ways to measure the consistency of data, hash function is used to take a snapshot of data at an instant in time

## Availability

> [!DEFINE] Availability
> Maintain availability of systems and services at all times

- System redundancy
- System backups and tests
- Increase system resiliency
- Equipment maintenance
- Up-to-date OS and software
- Plan for disasters and recovery
- Monitor unusual activity

Three design principles
- Eliminate single points of failure
- Provide for reliable crossover
- Detect failures as they occur
