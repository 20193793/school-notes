Using two DC motors and two wheels is the easiest way to build a mobile robot

# Single Wheel Drive
This design requires two passive caster wheels in the back, since three contact points are always required

Linear velocity and angular velocity of the robot are decoupled

Driving straight --> wheel in the middle and driven at desired speed
Driving in a curve --> The wheel is positioned at an angle matching the desired curve

This robot cannot turn on the spot

Minimum turning radius is the distance between the front wheel and midpoint of the backwheel

# Differential Drive
Two motors fixed on the left and right side of the robot, independently driven 

This designs require ore or more additional caster wheel, depending on the location of the driven wheels

Differential drive is mechanically simpler than single wheel drive because it requires rotation of a driven axis

But driving control is harder because it requires coordination of the two driven wheels

the minimal design with only single passive wheel can't have the driving wheels in the middle of the robot

A design with two passive wheels one each in the front and the back allows the rotation of the robot about its center but can introduce surface contact problems

> [!NOTE] Tracked Robots
> Allow better maneuverability in rough terrain due to its tracks and multiple points of contact

# Synchro-drive
An extension to single driven and steered wheel however we have 3 wheels that are all driven and steered and rotate together

Achieved by having a single motor attached to the wheels with a chain, one for steering and another motor for driving

Has two degrees of freedom

A synchro-drive is almost holonomous vehicle --> Can drive in any desired direction however it must stop and realign when changing from driving forwards to steering sideways

It can't drive and steer at the same time

# Ackermann Steering

> [!DEFINE] Ackermann Steering
> Standard drive and steer system for automobile with two combined driven rear wheels and two combined steering front wheels

Advantage --> Driving straight is not a problem since its driven via a common axis

Disadvantage --> Vehicle can't turn on the spot and the rear driving wheels suffer slippage in curves

Linear and angular velocities are decoupled like single steered since they are generated by separate motors

Steering wheels require a position controller

An additional sensor is required to indicate zero steering position

> [!NOTE]
> Higher quality model cars require servos for steering or either a servo or a electronic power controller for speed
