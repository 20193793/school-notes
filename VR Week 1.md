### How VR Works
Track movement in two ways:
- Outside-in (HTC Vive) --> Cameras are fixed to the environment
- Inside-out (Oculus Quest) --> A camera is attached to the user

> [!DEFINE] Degree of Freedom (DoF)
> A term used to outline motion about several axes. Relating to VR, it is used to explain how an individual can move in a headset and the number of axes tracked

Headsets can either have 3 or 6 DoF

3 DoF headsets restricts you to one group of axes, whether rotational or transitional
6 DoF headsets allows tracking for both position and orientation, both head and body movement

# Headsets
Three types:
- Phone(Mobile)-based (are 3 DoF, only head rotation)
- PC-based
- Standalone
