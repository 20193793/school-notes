# Advantages of Learning Robotics for Education
- A robot is a tangible, self-contained piece of real-world hardware
- Robots are relatable
- Solving real-world hardware is much harder than solving a theoretical problem
- Mobile robot programming is enjoyable and inspirational

# Mobile Robots
Types:
- Wheeled Robots
- Tracked Robots
- Flying robots
- Underwater robots

## Wheeled Robots
The simplest type of robots
Consists of one or more driven wheels and have optional passive, caster or steered wheels
Most designs require two motors for driving and steering

Ackermann Steering --> standard drive and steering for rear-driven passenger cars

A special type of wheeled robots is omni-directional, it has four driven wheels

Disadvantage of wheeled robots that they require flat surface or street for driving, 

## Tracked Robots
Tracked robots are more flexible and can navigate over rough terrain but cannot navigate as accurately
Tracked wheels require two motor, one for each track

## Legged Robots
- Can navigate over rough terrain or climb up stairs
- The more the legs, the easier it is to balance
- Requires two or more motors (degrees of freedom) per leg
- More biped (two-legged) robots have five or more motors per leg

# Sensor-Actuator-Controller Interaction

# Embedded Controller
Eye-con --> provide interface for a digital camera to drive a mobile robot on-board image processing

# Interfaces
Digital input, digital output, analog input
Analog output is not often required
