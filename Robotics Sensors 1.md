# What Makes a Machine a Robot
- Sensing --> planning --> acting
- Localization
- Obstacle detection
- Sensing for specific tasks

# Sensors

> [!DEFINE] Sensor
> A device that measures the physical quantity and converts it to an electrical signal which can be read by an instrument

Job --> convert a parameter from one form and report it in another form of energy

Important aspects of a sensor:
- Measurement technique
- Size
- Weight
- Operating temperature range
- Power consumption
- Price range

Data transfer from sensor to CPU:
- CPU-initiated (polling)
- Sensor-initiated (interrupt)

# Detectors

> [!DEFINE] Detectors
> A device that receives a signal and responds to it in a distinctive manner

A detector contains a sensor and a decision circuit
