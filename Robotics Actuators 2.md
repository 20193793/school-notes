# DC Motor Speed Control
Ways to control the power delivered to motor:
- Using resistor as voltage divider 
- Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)

## Method 1: Using Resistor
Resistor used to reduce the voltage/current delivered to the motor

This method is not practical:
- Resistor will consume large power and decrease efficiency
- High power resistor s big and need large space

## Method 2: Using PWM
Can be used to control speed, brightness and power

Based on repeated with high frequency and varying the ratio between POWER ON/POWER OFF

Average power delivered is also varied proportionally
